Retrofit CNC EMCO Concept Mill 55.

New PC with Linux CNC. New stepper motor drivers. New controller board Mesa 7i96s. New optional power supply for 24 volts.

The collet holder F1Z100 is different from F1Z010.

The new setting for DIP switch on Lenze 8200 VFD: SW3 - ON, other - off, for Signal at X3/8 0...5V.

TODO: 
Implement the use of the signal from the proximity sensors on the X, Y, Z axes. It is necessary to decide what to do with the door open state signal.

Thank you,
Yevgeniy Tolkunov.
